You must have heard of the “Activation Function” in Machine Learning/Deep Learning. But have you ever wondered what is the main task of these mathematical functions in our large neural network is? 

Let me tell you in simple terms:The main task of our activation function is to introduce “non-linearity” to our Neural Network.The thing is, non-linearity is so important because our real-world 
data is typically non-linear, so these activation functions help us generalize to our real-world dataset.
