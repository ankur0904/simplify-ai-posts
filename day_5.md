Yesterday, we discussed the importance of the activation function. Now, let’s discuss some of the important activation functions:

Sigmoid function: Squeeze input value into the range from 0 to 1, generally used when we are interested in the probability of something.
Hyperbolic Tangent: Squeeze input value into the range from -1 to +1; it converges faster than sigmoid.
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): It outputs 0 for negative inputs and the value itself for positive inputs, which generally helps prevent gradient vanishing and fast training.
