Let’s dive more into the loss function in Neural Networks.

Types of Neural Network

Quantifying Loss: measures the cost incurred from incorrect prediction.
Empirical Loss: The empirical loss measures the total loss over our entire dataset.
Binary Cross Entropy Loss: used with the model that outputs the probability between 0 and 1.
Mean Squared Error Loss: used with a regression model that outputs a continuous real number.
