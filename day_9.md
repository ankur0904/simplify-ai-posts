Have you ever wondered how training in neural networks actually happens?

Think of a neural network as a very long mathematical formula with many adjustable numbers, called weights. These numbers control how input data moves through the network to produce a prediction. At first, 
the weights are random.

During training, the network:

1. Makes a prediction
2. Measures how wrong it is using a loss function
3. Slightly adjusts the weights

This process is repeated many times.
